> HCF (Hardcore Factions) is a Minecraft server plugin that adds a new level of difficulty and excitement to the game. It introduces a faction-based gameplay system where players can form alliances, build bases, and engage in intense PvP battles. With features like land claiming, raiding, and custom enchantments, HCF offers a unique and challenging experience for Minecraft players.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a robust and scalable foundation for HCF servers. It allows developers to easily customize and extend functionalities to meet their specific needs. With an active and collaborative community, this core is the ideal choice for launching a new server or optimizing an existing one.
